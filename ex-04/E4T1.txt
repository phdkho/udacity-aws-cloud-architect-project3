# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet:
    * Change security group settings to not to allow ssh connections from the internet
    * Disable SSH password login on the application server instance

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; even in the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?
    * Restrict access to only specific IAM roles, i.e. using a new role specifically for accessing the S3 bucket (least privilege access)
    * Apply Default Server-side Encryption to the S3 Bucket: Server-side encryption could be enabled on the secret recipes bucket.
