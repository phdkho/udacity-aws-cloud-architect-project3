Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project:
    * Port 5000 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP
    * Port 22 and 80 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP
    * Port range 0 to 65535 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - TCP
    * Port range 0 to 65535 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - UDP
    According to the recommendations by the AWS Inspector, it was advised to modify the Security Groups or ACLs in the network path 

Provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities:
    *  Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22.
    *  Remove access to all the mentioned ports reachable from the internet.
    *  VPC flow logging should be enabled in all VPCs.
    *  S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled.
    *  Attached EBS volumes should be encrypted at-rest (Enable EBS server-side encryption).
