Dear reviewer,

Regarding attack simulation drills,

I have tried running the hydra command for a very long time more than 3 hours, however there is no indication from AWS GuardDuty about SSH Brute Force. even though I have done all the steps according to the instructions. :(

Thanks and best regards,
DinhPhan
